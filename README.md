This is a project made in C to simulate the outbreak of at Zombie infection

It utilises the pthread library run the program using several threads

The simulation is done using a celular atomata model to model a "world" in which, different types of cells interact with eachother throughout the program execution

The program features advanced thread handling techniques, such as mutexes for critical section handling and barrier to ensure the model runs one day at a time

The project includes 4 versions of the same program, a serial and parallel verison of the basic and latent versions of the zombie infection outbreak described in [When zombies attack!: Mathematical modelling
of an outbreak of zombie infection](url), using celular atomata to simulate these rules rather then the mathematical modeling described in the paper
